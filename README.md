## User Story

```
AS a user I want to be able to search for available dogs and cats in my area
WHEN I type in my zip code, I will see 20 results
I WANT to see a name, photo, and description for each result 
WHEN I click on an animal’s photo, I will be taken to the site where they are listed for adoption
SO THAT they can provide a home for a sheltered animal
```
